# Food-Price-Explorer-Using-Java

The idea of the project is to analyze and understand various deals on food provided by grocery stores available in Canada and/or worldwide:
1. Choose at least three websites to crawl (e.g. Walmart, Zehrs, Metro, etc.);
2. Specify the details of your search (dairy, eggs, meat, etc.)
3. Implement required features (see below instructions).

Features:
✓ Web crawler;
✓ Data validation using regular expressions;
✓ HTML parser;
✓ Inverted indexing
Inverted indexing allows us to perform quick searches without going through all the files. This can be
represented as an index data structure storing a mapping from content, such as words or numbers, to its
locations in a set of documents.

✓ Frequency count;
Frequency count shows the user the number of occurrences of a word in a specific url.

✓ Page ranking;
Page ranking is used to measure importance of a search result based on the number of occurrences.
Search keywords that are repeated more within a web page will be ranked higher than the others.
Ranking web pages can be performed using sorting, heaps or other data structures.

✓ Spell checking;
Spell checking can be achieved by constructing a vocabulary based on all existing words in text files.
Alternative word suggestions should be provided if no results are found.
Edit distance algorithm can be used to compare the user's input with existing word from source files.

✓ Word completion;
✓ Search frequency;
Ability to show the word that has been searched before as well as the number of times the word has been
searched.

✓ Finding patterns using regular expressions
